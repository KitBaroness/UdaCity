**CMMI Level Cost Calculation Methodology**

1. **Level 1 (Current State) - $300,000**
   * Based on current system maintenance:
     - Existing database licensing: ~$5,000/month = $60,000/year
     - Basic support staff (2 admins): ~$10,000/month = $120,000/year
     - Current security tools: ~$10,000/month = $120,000/year
   * These are actual measurable current costs

2. **Level 2 (Managed) - $450,000**
   * Payment Processor Integration:
     - Industry average integration cost: $15,000-20,000
     - Developer time: 3 developers × $100/hour × 160 hours = $48,000
     - Testing: 2 QA × $75/hour × 80 hours = $12,000
   * Project Planning:
     - Security architect: $150/hour × 160 hours = $24,000
     - Risk assessment team: 3 people × $125/hour × 80 hours = $30,000

**More Accurate Cost Analysis Would Need:**
1. Market Research:
   * Actual vendor quotes for payment processing
   * Real integration costs from similar projects
   * Current market rates for security professionals

2. Internal Cost Assessment:
   * Current infrastructure costs
   * Actual staff hourly rates
   * Real maintenance costs

3. Industry Benchmarks:
   * Similar implementation costs from other organizations
   * Standard CMMI level progression costs
   * Regulatory compliance investment data
